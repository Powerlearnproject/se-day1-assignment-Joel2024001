Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is a discipline focused on the systematic development of a high quality software products
 It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages e.g. Fotran.
2. Establisment of software engineering as a discipline. This occured in 1960s.
3. Advent of structured programming that occurred in 1970s.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture
and user interface.
3. Implement ation: Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Both are adaptable.
The difference between the two is, it uses sequences while for Agile it is iterative
and incremetal approach.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer : writes code and Implements software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer : Ensures 
software quality by designing and executing tests.
3. Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software project.
 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements.
2. Tight deadlines.
3. Technical debt.
Solutions
a. Effective communication.
b. Agile methodologies.
c. Regular reassesment of project goals and timelines, priolitisation of tasks.
 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing: This is testing individual component of a software.
2. 
Integration testing: This is testing interaction between different components of a software.
3. System testing: Involves testing the entire system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing: Testing the system against the requirements to ensure it meet users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interactionng with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible respense from AI models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: Show car
